a 340 dollar horse and a hundred dollar whore

don’t ever get the idea I am a poet; you can see me

at the racetrack any day half drunk

betting quarters, sidewheelers and straight thoroughs,

but let me tell you, there are some women there

who go where the money goes, and sometimes when you

look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores

you wonder sometimes if nature isn’t playing a joke

dealing out so much breast and ass and the way

it’s all hung together, you look and you look and

you look and you can’t believe it; there are ordinary women

and then there is something else that wants to make you

tear up paintings and break albums of Beethoven

across the back of the john; anyhow, the season

was dragging and the big boys were getting busted,

all the non-pros, the producers, the cameraman,

the pushers of Mary, the fur salesman, the owners

themselves, and Saint Louie was running this day:

a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close;

he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly

and 35 to 1, and I put a ten down on him.

the driver broke him wide

took him out by the fence where he’d be alone

even if he had to travel four times as far,

and that’s the way he went it

all the way by the outer fence

traveling two miles in one

and he won like he was mad as hell

and he wasn’t even tired,

and the biggest blonde of all

all ass and breast, hardly anything else

went to the payoff window with me.

that night I couldn’t destroy her

although the springs shot sparks

and they pounded on the walls.

later she sat there in her slip

drinking Old Grandad

and she said

what’s a guy like you doing

living in a dump like this?

and I said

I’m a poet

and she threw back her beautiful head and laughed.

you? you . . . a poet?

I guess you’re right, I said, I guess you’re right.

but still she looked good to me, she still looked good,

and all thanks to an ugly horse

who wrote this poem.

8 count

from my bed

I watch

3 birds

on a telephone   

wire.

one flies

off.

then   

another.

one is left,

then

it too

is gone.

my typewriter is

tombstone

still.

and I am

reduced to bird

watching.

just thought I'd

let you

know,

fucker.

About My Very Tortured Friend, Peter

he lives in a house with a swimming pool

and says the job is

killing him.

he is 27. I am 44. I can’t seem to

get rid of

him. his novels keep coming

back. “what do you expect me to do?” he screams

“go to New York and pump the hands of the

publishers?”

“no,” I tell him, “but quit your job, go into a

small room and do the

thing.”

“but I need ASSURANCE, I need something to

go by, some word, some sign!”

“some men did not think that way:

Van Gogh, Wagner—”

“oh hell, Van Gogh had a brother who gave him

paints whenever he

needed them!”

“look,” he said, “I’m over at this broad’s house today and

this guy walks in. a salesman. you know

how they talk. drove up in this new

car. talked about his vacation. said he went to

Frisco—saw Fidelio up there but forgot who

wrote it. now this guy is 54 years

old. so I told him: ‘Fidelio is Beethoven’s only

opera.’ and then I told

him: ‘you’re a jerk!’ ‘whatcha mean?’ he

asked. ‘I mean, you’re a jerk, you’re 54 years old and

you don’t know anything!’”

“what happened

then?”

“I walked out.”

“you mean you left him there with

her?”

“yes.”

“I can’t quit my job,” he said. “I always have trouble getting a

job. I walk in, they look at me, listen to me talk and

they think right away, ah ha! he’s too intelligent for

this job, he won’t stay

so there’s really no sense in hiring

him.

now, YOU walk into a place and you don’t have any trouble:

you look like an old wino, you look like a guy who needs a

job and they look at you and they think:

ah ha!: now here’s a guy who really needs work! if we hire

him he’ll stay a long time and work

HARD!”

“do any of those people,” he asks “know you are a

writer, that you write poetry?”

“no.”

“you never talk about

it. not even to

me! if I hadn’t seen you in that magazine I’d

have never known.”

“that’s right.”

“still, I’d like to tell these people that you are a

writer.”

“I’d still like to

tell them.”

“why?”

“well, they talk about you. they think you are just a

horseplayer and a drunk.”

“I am both of those.”

“well, they talk about you. you have odd ways. you travel alone.

I’m the only friend you

have.”

“yes.”

“they talk you down. I’d like to defend you. I’d like to tell

them you write

poetry.”

“leave it alone. I work here like they

do. we’re all the same.”

“well, I’d like to do it for myself then. I want them to know why

I travel with

you. I speak 7 languages, I know my music—”

“forget it.”

“all right, I’ll respect your

wishes. but there’s something else—”

“what?”

“I’ve been thinking about getting a

piano. but then I’ve been thinking about getting a

violin too but I can’t make up my

mind!”

“buy a piano.”

“you think

so?”

“yes.”

he walks away

thinking about

it.

I was thinking about it

too: I figure he can always come over with his

violin and more

sad music.

the difference between a bad poet and a good one is luck

I suppose so.

I was living in an attic in Philadelphia

It became very hot in the summer and so I stayed in the

bars. I didn’t have any money and so with what was almost left

I put a small ad in the paper and said I was a writer

looking for work . . .

which was a god damned lie; I was a writer

looking for a little time and a little food and some

attic rent.

a couple days later when I finally came home

from somewhere

the landlady said, there was somebody looking for

you. and I said,

there must be some mistake. she said,

no, it was a writer and he said he wanted you to help him write

a history book.

oh, fine, I said, and I knew with that I had another week’s

rent—I mean, on the cuff—

so I sat around drinking wine on credit and watching the hot pigeons

suffer and fuck on my hot roof.

I turned the radio on real loud

drank the wine and wondered how I could make a history book

interesting but true.

but the bastard never came back,

and I had to finally sign on with a railroad track gang

going West

and they gave us cans of food but no

openers

and we broke the cans against the seats and sides of

railroad cars a hundred years old with dust

the food wasn’t cooked and the water tasted like

candlewick

and I leaped off into a clump of brush somewhere in

Texas

all green with nice-looking houses in the

distance

I found a park

slept all night

and then they found me and put me in a cell

and they asked me about murders and

robberies.

they wanted to get a lot of stuff off the books

to prove their efficiency

but I wasn’t that tired

and they drove me to the next big town

fifty-seven miles away

the big one kicked me in the ass

and they drove off.

but I lucked it:

two weeks later I was sitting in the office of the city hall

half-asleep in the sun like the big fly on my elbow

and now and then she took me down to a meeting of the council

and I listened very gravely as if I knew what was happening

as if I knew how the funds of a halfass town were being

dismantled.

later I went to bed and woke up with teethmarks all over

me, and I said, Christ, watch it, baby! you might give me

cancer! and I’m rewriting the history of the Crimean War!

and they all came to her house—

all the cowboys, all the cowboys:

fat, dull and covered with dust.

and we all shook hands.

I had on a pair of old bluejeans, and they said

oh, you’re a writer, eh?

and I said: well, some think so.

and some still think so . . .

others, of course, haven’t quite wised up yet.

two weeks later they

ran me out

of town.

Hello, Willie Shoemaker

the Chinaman said don’t take the hardware

and gave me a steak I couldn’t cut (except the fat)

and there was an ant circling the coffee cup;

I left a dime tip and broke out a stick of cancer,

and outside I gave an old bum who looked about

the way I felt, I gave him a quarter,

and then I went up to see the old man

strong as steel girders, fit for bombers and blondes,

up the green rotten steps that housed rats

and past the secretaries showing leg and doing nothing

and the old man sat there looking at me

through two pairs of glasses and a vacation in Paris,

and he said, Kid, I hear you been takin’ Marylou out,

and I said, just to dinner, boss,

and he said, just to dinner, eh? you couldn’t hold

that broad’s pants on with all the rivets on 5th street,

and please remember you are a shipping clerk,

I am the boss here and I pay these broads and I pay you.

yes, sir, I said, and I felt he was going to skip it

but he slid my last check across the desk

and I took it and walked out

past

all the lovely legs, the skirts pulled up to the ass,

Marylou’s ass, Ann’s ass, Vicki’s ass, all of them,

and I went down to the bar

and George said whatya gonna do now,

and I said go to Russia or Hollywood Park,

and I looked up in time to see Marylou come in,

the long thin nose, the delicate face, the lips, the legs,

the breasts, the music, the talk the love the laughing

and she said

I quit when I found out

and the bastard got down on his knees and cried

and kissed the hem of my skirt and offered me money

and I

walked out

and he blubbered like a baby.

George, I said, another drink, and I put a quarter in

the juke

and the sun came out

and I looked outside in time to see the old bum

with my quarter

and a little more luck

that had turned into a happy wine-bottle,

and a bird even flew by cheep cheep,

right there on Eastside downtown, no kidding,

and the Chinaman came in for a quickie

claiming somebody had stolen a spoon and a coffee cup

and I leaned over and bit Marylou on the ear

and the whole joint rocked with music and freedom

and I decided that Russia was too far away

and Hollywood Park just close enough.

I Am Visited by an Editor and a Poet

I had just won $115 from the headshakers and

was naked upon my bed

listening to an opera by one of the Italians

and had just gotten rid of a very loose lady

when there was a knock upon the wood,

and since the cops had just raided a month or so ago,

I screamed out rather on edge—

who the hell is it? what you want, man?

I’m your publisher! somebody screamed back,

and I hollered, I don’t have a publisher,

try the place next door, and he screamed back,

you’re Charles Bukowski, aren’t you? and I got up and

peeked through the iron grill to make sure it wasn’t a cop,

and I placed a robe upon my nakedness,

kicked a beercan out of the way and bade them enter,

an editor and a poet.

only one would drink a beer (the editor)

so I drank two for the poet and one for myself

and they sat there sweating and watching me

and I sat there trying to explain

that I wasn’t really a poet in the ordinary sense,

I told them about the stockyards and the slaughterhouse

and the racetracks and the conditions of some of our jails,

and the editor suddenly pulled five magazines out of a portfolio

and tossed them in between the beercans

and we talked about Flowers of Evil, Rimbaud, Villon,

and what some of the modern poets looked like:

J.B. May and Wolf the Hedley are very immaculate, clean fingernails, etc.;

I apologized for the beercans, my beard, and everything on the floor

and pretty soon everybody was yawning

and the editor suddenly stood up and I said,

are you leaving?

and then the editor and the poet were walking out the door,

and then I thought well hell they might not have liked

what they saw

but I’m not selling beercans and Italian opera and

torn stockings under the bed and dirty fingernails,

I’m selling rhyme and life and line,

and I walked over and cracked a new can of beer

and I looked at the five magazines with my name on the cover

and wondered what it meant,

wondered if we are writing poetry or all huddling in

one big tent

                  clasping assholes.

i can't stay in the same room with that woman for five minutes

I went over the other day

to pick up my daughter.

her mother came out with workman’s

overalls on.

I gave her the child support money

and she laid a sheaf of poems on me by one

Manfred Anderson.

I read them.

he’s great, she said.

does he send this shit out? I asked.

oh no, she said, Manfred wouldn’t do that.

why?

well, I don’t know exactly.

listen, I said, you know all the poets who

don’t send their shit out.

the magazines aren’t ready for them, she said,

they’re too far advanced for publication.

oh for christ’s sake, I said, do you really

believe that?

yes, yes, I really believe that, she

answered.

look, I said, you don’t even have the kid ready

yet. she doesn’t have her shoes on. can’t you

put her shoes on?

your daughter is 8 years old, she said,

she can put her own shoes on.

listen, I said to my daughter, for christ’s sake

will you put your shoes on?

Manfred never screams, said her mother.

OH HOLY JESUS CHRIST! I yelled

you see, you see? she said, you haven’t changed.

what time is it? I asked.

4:30. Manfred did submit some poems once, she said,

but they sent them back and he was terribly

upset.

you’ve got your shoes on, I said to my daughter,

let’s go.

her mother walked to the door with us.

have a nice day, she said.

fuck off, I said.

when she closed the door there was a sign pasted to

the outside. it said:

SMILE.

I didn’t.

we drove down Pico on the way in.

I stopped outside the Red Ox.

I’ll be right back, I told my daughter.

I walked in, sat down, and ordered a scotch and

water. over the bar there was a little guy popping in and

out of a door holding a very red, curved penis

in his hand.

can’t

can’t you make him stop? I asked the barkeep.

can’t you shut that thing off?

what’s the matter with you, buddy? he asked.

I submit my poems to the magazines, I said.

you submit your poems to the magazines? he asked.

you are god damned right I do, I said.

I finished my drink and got back to the car.

I drove down Pico Boulevard.

the remainder of the day was bound to be better.

i wanted to overthrow the government but all i brought down was somebody's wife

30 dogs, 20 men on 20 horses and one fox

and look here, they write,

you are a dupe for the state, the church,

you are in the ego-dream,

read your history, study the monetary system,

note that the racial war is 23,000 years old.

well, I remember 20 years ago, sitting with an old Jewish tailor,

his nose in the lamplight like a cannon sighted on the enemy; and

there was an Italian pharmacist who lived in an expensive apartment

in the best part of town; we plotted to overthrow

a tottering dynasty, the tailor sewing buttons on a vest,

the Italian poking his cigar in my eye, lighting me up,

a tottering dynasty myself, always drunk as possible,

well-read, starving, depressed, but actually

a good young piece of ass would have solved all my rancor,

but I didn’t know this; I listened to my Italian and my Jew

and I went out down dark alleys smoking borrowed cigarettes

and watching the backs of houses come down in flames,

but somewhere we missed: we were not men enough,

       large or small enough,

or we only wanted to talk or we were bored, so the anarchy

       fell through,

and the Jew died and the Italian grew angry because I stayed

       with his

wife when he went down to the pharmacy; he did not care to have

his personal government overthrown, and she overthrew easy, and

I had some guilt: the children were asleep in the other bedroom

but later I won $200 in a crap game and took a bus to New Orleans

and I stood on the corner listening to the music coming from bars

and then I went inside to the bars,

and I sat there thinking about the dead Jew,

how all he did was sew on buttons and talk,

and how he gave way although he was stronger than any of us

he gave way because his bladder would not go on,

and maybe that saved Wall Street and Manhattan

and the Church and Central Park West and Rome and the

Left Bank, but the pharmacist’s wife, she was nice,

she was tired of bombs under the pillow and hissing the Pope,

and she had a very nice figure, very good legs,

but I guess she felt as I: that the weakness was not Government

but Man, one at a time, that men were never as strong as

       their ideas

and that ideas were governments turned into men;

and so it began on a couch with a spilled martini

and it ended in the bedroom: desire, revolution,

nonsense ended, and the shades rattled in the wind,

rattled like sabers, cracked like cannon,

and 30 dogs, 20 men on 20 horses chased one fox

across the fields under the sun,

and I got out of bed and yawned and scratched my belly

and knew that soon      very soon      I would have to get

very drunk      again.

Interview by a Guggenheim Recipient

this South American up here on a Gugg

walked in with his whore

and she sat on the edge of my bed and

crossed her fine legs

and I kept looking at her legs

and he pulled at his stringy necktie

and I had a hangover

and he asked me

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE AMERICAN

POETS?

and I told him I didn’t think very much

of the American poets

and then he went on to ask some other

very dull questions

(as his whore’s legs layed along the side of

my brain) like

WELL? YOU DON’T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING

BUT IF YOU WERE TEACHING A CLASS AND ONE OF THE

STUDENTS ASKED YOU WHICH AMERICAN POETS

THEY SHOULD READ

WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM?

she crossed her legs as I watched and I thought

I could knock him out with one punch

rape her in 4 minutes

catch a train for L.A.

get off in Arizona and walk off into the desert

and I couldn’t tell him that I would never teach

a class

that along with not liking American poetry

that I didn’t like American classes either

or the job that they would expect me to

do,

so I said

Whitman, T.S. Eliot, D.H. Lawrence’ poems about

reptiles and beasts, Auden. and then I

realized that Whitman was the only true American,

that Eliot was not an American somehow and the

others certainly not, and

he knew it too

he knew that I had fucked up

but I made no apologies

thought some more about rape

I almost loved the woman but I knew that when she walked out

that I would never see her again

and we shook hands and the Gugg said

he’d send me the article when it came out

but I knew that he didn’t have an article

and he knew it too

and then he said

I will send you some of my poems translated into

English

and I said fine

and I watched them walk out of the place

I watched her highheels clack down the tall

green steps

and then both of them were gone

but I kept remembering her dress sliding all over her

like a second skin

and I was wild with mourning and love and sadness

and being a fool unable to

communicate

anything

and I walked in and finished that beer

cracked another

put on my ragged king’s coat

and walked out into the New Orleans street

and that very night

I sat with my friends and acted vile and

the ass

much mouth and villainy

and cruelness

and they never

knew why.

The Japanese Wife

O lord, he said, Japanese women,

real women, they have not forgotten,

bowing and smiling

closing the wounds men have made;

but American women will kill you like they

tear a lampshade,

American women care less than a dime,

they’ve gotten derailed,

they’re too nervous to make good:

always scowling, belly-aching,

disillusioned, overwrought;

but oh lord, say, the Japanese women:

there was this one,

I came home and the door was locked

and when I broke in she broke out the bread knife

and chased me under the bed

and her sister came

and they kept me under that bed for two days,

and when I came out, at last,

she didn’t mention attorneys,

just said, you will never wrong me again,

and I didn’t; but she died on me,

and dying, said, you can wrong me now,

and I did,

but you know, I felt worse then

than when she was living;

there was no voice, no knife,

nothing but little Japanese prints on the wall,

all those tiny people sitting by red rivers

with flying green birds,

and I took them down and put them face down

in a drawer with my shirts,

and it was the first time I realized

that she was dead, even though I buried her;

and some day I’ll take them all out again,

all the tan-faced little people

sitting happily by their bridges and huts

and mountains—

but not right now,

not just yet.

the trash men

here they come

these guys

grey truck

radio playing

they are in a hurry

it’s quite exciting:

shirt open

bellies hanging out

they run out the trash bins

roll them out to the fork lift

and then the truck grinds it upward

with far too much sound . . .

they had to fill out application forms

to get these jobs

they are paying for homes and

drive late model cars

they get drunk on Saturday night

now in the Los Angeles sunshine

they run back and forth with their trash bins

all that trash goes somewhere

and they shout to each other

then they are all up in the truck

driving west toward the sea

none of them know

that I am alive

REX DISPOSAL CO.

Trollius and trellises

of course, I may die in the next ten minutes

and I’m ready for that

but what I’m really worried about is

that my editor-publisher might retire

even though he is ten years younger than

I.

it was just 25 years ago (I was at that ripe

old age of 45)

when we began our unholy alliance to

test the literary waters,

neither of us being much

known.

I think we had some luck and still have some

of same

yet

the odds are pretty fair

that he will opt for warm and pleasant

afternoons

in the garden

long before I.

writing is its own intoxication

while publishing and editing,

attempting to collect bills

carries its own

attrition

which also includes dealing with the

petty bitchings and demands

of many

so-called genius darlings who are

not.

I won’t blame him for getting

out

and hope he sends me photos of his

Rose Lane, his

Gardenia Avenue.

will I have to seek other

promulgators?

that fellow in the Russian

fur hat?

or that beast in the East

with all that hair

in his ears, with those wet and

greasy lips?

or will my editor-publisher

upon exiting for that world of Trollius and

trellis

hand over the

machinery

of his former trade to a

cousin, a

daughter or

some Poundian from Big

Sur?

or will he just pass the legacy on

to the

Shipping Clerk

who will rise like

Lazarus,

fingering new-found

importance?

one can imagine terrible

things:

“Mr. Chinaski, all your work

must now be submitted in

Rondo form

and

typed

triple-spaced on rice

paper.”

power corrupts,

life aborts

and all you

have left

is a

bunch of

warts.

“no, no, Mr. Chinaski:

Rondo form!”

“hey, man,” I’ll ask,

“haven’t you heard of

the thirties?”

“the thirties? what’s

that?”

my present editor-publisher

and I

at times

did discuss the thirties,

the Depression

and

some of the little tricks it

taught us—

like how to endure on almost

nothing

and move forward

anyhow.

well, John, if it happens enjoy your

divertissement to

plant husbandry,

cultivate and aerate

between

bushes, water only in the

early morning, spread

shredding to discourage

weed growth

and

as I do in my writing:

use plenty of

manure.

and thank you

for locating me there at

5124 DeLongpre Avenue

somewhere between

alcoholism and

madness.

together we

laid down the gauntlet

and there are takers

even at this late date

still to be

found

through the

trouble with spain

I got in the shower

and burned my balls

last Wednesday.

met this painter called Spain,

no, he was a cartoonist,

well, I met him at a party

and everybody got mad at me

because I didn’t know who he was

or what he did.

he was rather a handsome guy

and I guess he was jealous because

I was so ugly.

they told me his name

and he was leaning against the wall

looking handsome, and I said:

hey, Spain, I like that name: Spain.

but I don’t like you. why don’t we step out

in the garden and I’ll kick the shit out of your

ass?

this made the hostess angry

and she walked over and rubbed his pecker

while I went to the crapper

and heaved.

but everybody's angry at me.

Bukowski, he can’t write, he’s had it.

washed-up. look at him drink.

he never used to come to parties.

now he comes to parties and drinks everything

up and insults real talent.

I used to admire him when he cut his wrists

and when he tried to kill himself with

gas. look at him now leering at that 19 year old

girl, and you know he

can’t get it up.

I not only burnt my balls in that shower

last Wednesday, I spun around to get out of the burning

water and burnt my bunghole

too.

vegas

there was a frozen tree that I wanted to paint

but the shells came down

and in Vegas looking across at a green sunshade

at 3:30 in the morning,

I died without nails, without a copy of the Atlantic Monthly,

the windows screamed like doves moaning the bombing of Milan

and I went out to live with the rats

but the lights were too bright

and I thought maybe I'd better go back and sit in a

poetry class:

             a marvelous description of a gazelle

             is hell;

             the cross sits like a fly on my window,

             my mother’s breath stirs small leaves

             in my mind;

and I hitch-hiked back to L.A. through hangover clouds

and I pulled a letter from my pocket and read it

and the truckdriver said, what’s that?

and I said, there's some gal up North who used to

sleep with Pound, she's trying to tell me that H.D.

was our greatest scribe; well, Hilda gave us a few pink

Grecian gods in with the chinaware, but after reading her

I still have 140 icicles hanging from my bones.

I'm not going all the way to L.A., the truckdriver said.

it's all right, I said, the calla lilies nod to our minds

and someday we’ll all go home

together.

in fact, he said, this is as far

as we go.

so I let him have it; old withered whore of time

your breasts taste the sour cream of dreaming . . .

he let me out

in the middle of the desert;

to die is to die is to die,

old phonographs in cellars,

joe di maggio,

magazines in with the onions . . .

an old Ford picked me up

45 minutes later

and, this time,

I kept my mouth

shut.

wax job

man, he said, sitting on the steps
your car sure needs a wash and wax job
I can do it for you for 5 bucks,
I got the wax, I got the rags, I got everything
I need.

I gave him the 5 and went upstairs.
when I came down 4 hours later
he was sitting on the steps drunk
and offered me a can of beer.
he said he’d get the car the next
day.

the next day he got drunk again and
I loaned him a dollar for a bottle of
wine. his name was Mike
a world war II veteran.
his wife worked as a nurse.

the next day I came down and he was sitting
on the steps and he said,
you know, I been sitting here looking at your car,
wondering just how I was gonna do it,
I wanna do it real good.

the next day Mike said it looked like rain
and it sure as hell wouldn’t make any sense
to wash and wax a car when it was gonna rain.

the next day it looked like rain again.
and the next.
then I didn’t see him anymore.
a week later I saw his wife and she said,
they took Mike to the hospital,
he’s all swelled-up, they say it’s from the
drinking.

listen, I told her, he said he was going to wax my
car, I gave him 5 dollars to wax my
car.

he’s in the critical ward, she said,
he might die . . .

I was sitting in their kitchen
drinking with his wife
when the phone rang.
she handed the phone to me.
it was Mike. listen, he said, come down and
get me, I can’t stand this
place.

I drove on down there, walked into the
hospital, walked up to his bed and
said, let’s go Mike.

they wouldn’t give him his clothes
so Mike walked to the elevator in his
gown.

we got on and there was a kid driving the
elevator and eating a popsicle.
nobody’s allowed to leave here in a gown,
he said.

you just drive this thing, kid, I said,
we’ll worry about the gown.

Mike was all puffed-up, triple size
but I got him into the car somehow
and gave him a cigarette.

I stopped at the liquor store for 2 six packs
then went on in. I drank with Mike and his wife until
11 p.m.
then went upstairs . . .

where’s Mike? I asked his wife 3 days later,
you know he said he was going to wax my car.

Mike died, she said, he’s gone.

you mean he died? I asked.

yes, he died, she said.

I’m sorry, I said, I’m very sorry

it rained for a week after that and I figured the only
way I’d get the 5 back was to go to bed with his wife
but you know
she moved out 2 weeks later

an old guy with white hair moved in there
and he had one blind eye and played the French Horn.
there was no way I could make it with
him.

the weather is hot on the back of my watch

the weather is hot on the back of my watch

which is down at Finkelstein’s

who is gifted with 3 balls

but no heart, but you’ve got to understand

when the bull goes down

on the whore, the heart is laid aside for something else,

and let’s not over-rate the obvious decency

for in a crap game you may be cutting down

some wobbly king of 6 kids

and a hemorrhoid butt on his last unemployment check,

and who is to say the rose is greater than the thorn?

not I, Henry,

and when your love gets flabby knees and prefers flat shoes,

maybe you should have stuck it into something else

like an oil well

or a herd of cows.

I’m too old to argue,

I’ve gone with the poem

and been k.o.’d with the old sucker-punch

round after round,

but sometimes I like to think of the Kaiser

or any other fool full of medals and nothing else,

or the first time we read Dos

or Eliot with his trousers rolled;

the weather is hot on the back of my watch

which is down at Finkelstein’s,

but you know what they say: things are tough all over,

and I remember once on the bum in Texas

I watched a crow-blast, one hundred farmers with one hundred shotguns

jerking off the sky with a giant penis of hate

and the crows came down half-dead, half-living,

and they clubbed them to death to save their shells

but they ran out of shells before they ran out of crows

and the crows came back and walked around the pellets and

stuck out their tongues

and mourned their dead and elected new leaders

and then all at once flew home to fuck to fill the gap.

you can only kill what shouldn’t be there.

and Finkelstein should be there and my watch

and maybe myself, and I realize that if the poems are bad

they are supposed to be bad and if they are good

they are likewise supposed to be—although there is a minor

fight to be fought,

but still I am sad

because I was in this small town somewhere in the badlands,

way off course, not even wanting to be there,

two dollars in my wallet, and a farmer turned to me

and asked me what time it was

and I wouldn’t tell him,

and later they gathered them up for burning

as if they were no better than dung with feathers,

feathers and a little gasoline,

and from the bottom of one pile

a not-quite-dead crow smiled at me.

it was 4:35 p.m.

x-pug

he hooked to the body hard

took it well

and loved to fight

had seven in a row and a small fleck

over one eye,

and then he met a kid from Camden

with arms thin as wires—

it was a good one,

the safe lions roared and threw money;

they were both up and down many times,

but he lost that one

and he lost the rematch

in which neither of them fought at all,

hanging on to each other like lovers through the boos,

and now he’s over at Mike’s

changing tires and oil and batteries,

the fleck over the eye

still young,

but you don’t ask him,

you don’t ask him anything

except maybe

you think it’s going to rain?

or

you think the sun’s gonna come out?

to which he’ll usually answer

hell no,

but you’ll have your important tank of gas

and drive off.

The Crunch

too much
too little

too fat
too thin
or nobody.

laughter or
tears

haters
lovers

strangers with faces like
the backs of
thumb tacks

armies running through
streets of blood
waving winebottles
bayoneting and fucking
virgins.

or an old guy in a cheap room
with a photograph of M. Monroe.

there is a loneliness in this world so great
that you can see it in the slow movement of
the hands of a clock.

people so tired
mutilated
either by love or no love.

people just are not good to each other
one on one.

the rich are not good to the rich
the poor are not good to the poor.

we are afraid.

our educational system tells us
that we can all be
big-ass winners.

it hasn't told us
about the gutters
or the suicides.

or the terror of one person
aching in one place
alone

untouched
unspoken to

watering a plant.

people are not good to each other.
people are not good to each other.
people are not good to each other.

I suppose they never will be.
I don't ask them to be.

but sometimes I think about
it.

the beads will swing
the clouds will cloud
and the killer will behead the child
like taking a bite out of an ice cream cone.

too much
too little

too fat
too thin
or nobody

more haters than lovers.

people are not good to each other.
perhaps if they were
our deaths would not be so sad.

meanwhile I look at young girls
stems
flowers of chance.

there must be a way.

surely there must be a way we have not yet
thought of.

who put this brain inside of me?

it cries
it demands
it says that there is a chance.

it will not say
"no."

Loneliness

I've never been lonely. I've been in a room -- I've felt suicidal. I've been depressed. I've felt awful -- awful beyond all -- but I never felt that one other person could enter that room and cure what was bothering me...or that any number of people could enter that room. In other words, loneliness is something I've never been bothered with because I've always had this terrible itch for solitude. It's being at a party, or at a stadium full of people cheering for something, that I might feel loneliness. I'll quote Ibsen, "The strongest men are the most alone." I've never thought, "Well, some beautiful blonde will come in here and give me a fuck-job, rub my balls, and I'll feel good." No, that won't help. You know the typical crowd, "Wow, it's Friday night, what are you going to do? Just sit there?" Well, yeah. Because there's nothing out there. It's stupidity. Stupid people mingling with stupid people. Let them stupidify themselves. I've never been bothered with the need to rush out into the night. I hid in bars, because I didn't want to hide in factories. That's all. Sorry for all the millions, but I've never been lonely. I like myself. I'm the best form of entertainment I have. Let's drink more wine!

bluebird

there’s a bluebird in my heart that 

wants to get out 

but I’m too tough for him, 

I say, stay in there, I’m not going 

to let anybody see 

you. 

there’s a bluebird in my heart 

that wants to get out 

but I pour whiskey on him and inhale 

cigarette smoke 

and the whores and the bartenders 

and the grocery clerks 

never know that 

he’s 

in there. 

there’s a bluebird in my heart that 

wants to get out 

but I’m too tough for him, 

I say, 

stay down, do you want to mess 

me up? 

you want to screw up the 

works? you want to blow my book sales in 

Europe? 

there’s a bluebird in my heart that 

wants to get out 

but I’m too clever, I only let him out 

at night sometimes 

when everybody’s asleep. 

I say, I know that you’re there, 

so don’t be 

sad. 

then I put him back, 

but he’s singing a little 

in there, I haven’t quite let him 

die 

and we sleep together like 

that 

with our 

secret pact 

and it’s nice enough to 

make a man 

weep, but I don’t 

weep, do 

you?

nirvana

not much chance, 

completely cut loose from 

purpose, 

he was a young man 

riding a bus 

through North Carolina 

on the way to 

somewhere 

and it began to snow 

and the bus stopped 

at a little cafe 

in the hills 

and the passengers 

entered. 

he sat at the counter 

with the others, 

he ordered and the 

food arrived. 

the meal was 

particularly 

good 

and the 

coffee. 

the waitress was 

unlike the women 

he had 

known. 

she was unaffected, 

there was a natural 

humor which came 

from her. 

the fry cook said 

crazy things. 

the dishwasher, 

in back, 

laughed, a good 

clean 

pleasant 

laugh. 

the young man watched 

the snow through the 

windows. 

he wanted to stay 

in that cafe 

forever. 

the curious feeling 

swam through him 

that everything 

was 

beautiful 

there, 

that it would always 

stay beautiful 

there. 

then the bus driver 

told the passengers 

that it was time 

to board. 

the young man 

thought, I’ll just sit 

here, I’ll just stay 

here. 

but then 

he rose and followed 

the others into the 

bus. 

he found his seat 

and looked at the cafe 

through the bus 

window. 

then the bus moved 

off, down a curve, 

downward, out of 

the hills. 

the young man 

looked straight 

forward. 

he heard the other 

passengers 

speaking 

of other things, 

or they were 

reading 

or 

attempting to 

sleep. 

they had not 

noticed 

the 

magic. 

the young man 

put his head to 

one side, 

closed his 

eyes, 

pretended to 

sleep. 

there was nothing 

else to do— 

just listen to the 

sound of the 

engine, 

the sound of the 

tires 

in the 

snow.

Dreamlessly

Old, grey-haired waitresses

in cafes at night

have given it up,

and as I walk down sidewalks of

light and look into windows

of nursing homes

I can see that it is no longer

with them.

I see people sitting on park benches

and I can see by the way they

sit and look

that it is gone.

I see people driving cars

and I see by the way

they drive their cars

that they neither love nor are

loved -

nor do they consider

sex. It is all forgotten

like an old movie.

I see people in department stores and

supermarkets

walking down aisles

buying things

and I can see by the way their clothing

fits them and by the way they walk

and by their faces and their eyes

that they care for nothing

and that nothing cares

for them.

I see a hundred people a day

who have given up

entirely.

If I go to the racetrack

or a sporting event

I can see thousands

that feel for nothing or

no one

and get no feeling

back.

Everywhere I see those who

crave nothing but

food, shelter, and

clothing; they concentrate

on that,

dreamlessly

I do not understand why these people do not

vanish

I do not understand why these people do not

expire

why the clouds

do not murder them

or why the dogs

do not murder them

or why the flowers and the children

do not murder them,

I do not understand.

I suppose they are murdered

yet I can’t adjust to the

fact of them

because they are so many.

Each day,

each night,

there are more of them

in the subways and

in the buildings and

in the parks

they feel no terror

at not loving

or at not

being loved

so many many many

of my fellow

creatures.

The Strongest of the Strange

you won’t see them often
for wherever the crowd is
they
are not.

those odd ones, not
many
but from them
come
the few
good paintings
the few
good symphonies
the few
good books
and other
works.

and from the
best of the
strange ones
perhaps
nothing.

they are
their own
paintings
their own
books
their own
music
their own
work.

sometimes I think
I see
them – say
a certain old
man
sitting on a
certain bench
in a certain
way

or
a quick face
going the other
way
in a passing
automobile

or
there’s a certain motion
of the hands
of a bag-boy or a bag-
girl
while packing
supermarket
groceries.

sometimes
it is even somebody
you have been
living with
for some
time –
you will notice
a
lightning quick
glance
never seen
from them
before.

sometimes
you will only note
their
existance
suddenly
in
vivid
recall
some months
some years
after they are
gone.

I remember
such a
one –
he was about
20 years old
drunk at
10 a.m.
staring into
a cracked
New Orleans
mirror

facing dreaming
against the
walls of
the world

where
did I
go?

The Genius of the crowd

there is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average
human being to supply any given army on any given day

and the best at murder are those who preach against it
and the best at hate are those who preach love
and the best at war finally are those who preach peace

those who preach god, need god
those who preach peace do not have peace
those who preach peace do not have love

beware the preachers
beware the knowers
beware those who are always reading books
beware those who either detest poverty
or are proud of it
beware those quick to praise
for they need praise in return
beware those who are quick to censor
they are afraid of what they do not know
beware those who seek constant crowds for
they are nothing alone
beware the average man the average woman
beware their love, their love is average
seeks average

but there is genius in their hatred
there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you
to kill anybody
not wanting solitude
not understanding solitude
they will attempt to destroy anything
that differs from their own
not being able to create art
they will not understand art
they will consider their failure as creators
only as a failure of the world
not being able to love fully
they will believe your love incomplete
and then they will hate you
and their hatred will be perfect

like a shining diamond
like a knife
like a mountain
like a tiger
like hemlock

their finest art

A Smile to Remember

we had goldfish and they circled around and around
in the bowl on the table near the heavy drapes
covering the picture window and
my mother, always smiling, wanting us all
to be happy, told me, "be happy Henry!"
and she was right: it's better to be happy if you
can
but my father continued to beat her and me several times a week while
raging inside his 6-foot-two frame because he couldn't
understand what was attacking him from within.

my mother, poor fish,
wanting to be happy, beaten two or three times a
week, telling me to be happy: "Henry, smile!
why don't you ever smile?"

and then she would smile, to show me how, and it was the
saddest smile I ever saw

one day the goldfish died, all five of them,
they floated on the water, on their sides, their
eyes still open,
and when my father got home he threw them to the cat
there on the kitchen floor and we watched as my mother
smiled

The Suicide Kid

I went to the worst of bars hoping to get killed. but all I could do was to get drunk again. worse, the bar patrons even ended up liking me. there I was trying to get pushed over the dark edge and I ended up with free drinks while somewhere else some poor son-of-a-bitch was in a hospital bed, tubes sticking out all over him as he fought like hell to live. nobody would help me die as the drinks kept coming, as the next day waited for me with its steel clamps, its stinking anonymity, its incogitant attitude. death doesn't always come running when you call it, not even if you call it from a shining castle or from an ocean liner or from the best bar on earth (or the worst). such impertinence only makes the gods hesitate and delay. ask me: I'm 72.

Alone with Everybody

the flesh covers the bone
and they put a mind
in there and
sometimes a soul,
and the women break
vases against the walls
and the men drink too
much
and nobody finds the
one
but keep
looking
crawling in and out
of beds.
flesh covers
the bone and the
flesh searches
for more than
flesh.

there's no chance
at all:
we are all trapped
by a singular
fate.

nobody ever finds
the one.

the city dumps fill
the junkyards fill
the madhouses fill
the hospitals fill
the graveyards fill

nothing else
fills.

For Jane

225 days under grass
and you know more than I.
they have long taken your blood,
you are a dry stick in a basket.
is this how it works?
in this room
the hours of love
still make shadows.

when you left
you took almost
everything.
I kneel in the nights
before tigers
that will not let me be.

what you were
will not happen again.
the tigers have found me
and I do not care.

We Will Defeat Death

You know and I know and thee know
that as the yellow shade rips
as the cat leaps wild-eyed
as the old bartender leans on the wood
as the hummingbird sleeps
you know and I know and thee know
as the tanks practice on false battlefields
as your tires work the freeway
as the midget drunk on cheap bourbon cries alone at night
as the bulls are carefully bred for the matadors
as the grass watches you
and the trees watch you
as the sea holds creatures vast and true
you know and I know and thee know
the sadness and the glory of two slippers under a bed
the ballet of your heart dancing with your blood
young girls of love who will someday hate their mirrors
overtime in hell
lunch with sick salad
you know and I know and thee know
the end as we know it now it seems such a lousy trick
after the lousy agony but
you know and I know and thee know
the joy that sometimes comes along out of nowhere
rising like a falcon moon across the impossibility
you know and I know and thee know
the cross-eyed craziness of total elation
we know we finally have not been cheated
you know and I know and thee know
as we look at our hands our feet our lives our way
the sleeping hummingbird
the murdered dead of armies
the sun that eats you as you face it
you know and I know and thee know
we will defeat death.

So Now?

the words have come and gone,
I sit ill.
the phone rings, the cats sleep.
Linda vacuums.
I am waiting to live,
waiting to die.
I wish I could ring in some bravery.
it's a lousy fix
but the tree outside doesn't know:
I watch it moving with the wind
in the late afternoon sun.
there's nothing to declare here,
just a waiting.
each faces it alone.
Oh, I was once young,
Oh, I was once unbelievably
young!

Rain

a symphony orchestra.
there is a thunderstorm,
they are playing a Wagner overture
and the people leave their seats under the trees
and run inside to the pavilion
the women giggling, the men pretending calm,
wet cigarettes being thrown away,
Wagner plays on, and then they are all under the
pavilion. the birds even come in from the trees
and enter the pavilion and then it is the Hungarian
Rhapsody #2 by Lizst, and it still rains, but look,
one man sits alone in the rain
listening. the audience notices him. they turn
and look. the orchestra goes about its
business. the man sits in the night in the rain,
listening. there is something wrong with him,
isn't there?
he came to hear the
music.

Consummation of Grief

I even hear the mountains
the way they laugh
up and down their blue sides
and down in the water
the fish cry
and the water
is their tears.
I listen to the water
on nights I drink away
and the sadness becomes so great
I hear it in my clock
it becomes knobs upon my dresser
it becomes paper on the floor
it becomes a shoehorn
a laundry ticket
it becomes
cigarette smoke
climbing a chapel of dark vines. . .
it matters little
very little love is not so bad
or very little life
what counts
is waiting on walls
I was born for this
I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead.

Creativity

you know, I’ve either had a family, a job,
something has always been in the
way
but now
I’ve sold my house, I’ve found this
place, a large studio, you should see the space and
the light.
for the first time in my life I’m going to have
a place and the time to
create.”

no baby, if you’re going to create
you’re going to create whether you wor
k 16 hours a day in a coal mine
or
you’re going to create in a small room with 3 children
while you’re on
welfare,
you’re going to create with part of your mind and your
body blown
away,
you’re going to create blind
crippled
demented,
you’re going to create with a cat crawling up your
back while
the whole city trembles in earthquake, bombardment,
flood and fire.

baby, air and light and time and space
have nothing to do with it
and don’t create anything
except maybe a longer life to find
new excuses
for.
